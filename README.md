# Horiseon Cleanup Crew

## Description
For this project I delved through the html and css code of the website and tried to clean it up as best i could. Cleaning up entails taking out unecessary code, replacing semantic elements, and making the site more accessible. My motivation for this project was to test my knowledge of html and css. I wanted to better understand how i could manipulate code without changing the outcome and see if i could recognize unecessary elements. The updated code solves the problem of a longer code base by making it shorter and more concise. Making the code more accesible and easier to read. I learned how to recognize some uneccesary pieces of code and how to look through code to see what it is affecting on the website.
